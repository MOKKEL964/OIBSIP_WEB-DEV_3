# Temperature Converter Website

# Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple and interactive *Temperature Converter Website* that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit( also Kelvin) . This project was built as part of the Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship to strengthen basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

# Tools & Technologies Used
- HTML5 – For structuring the web content  
- CSS – For styling and layout  
- JavaScript – For functionality and logic implementation  
- Visual Studio Code – Code editor used for writing and testing the code  

# Steps Performed

1. *Created Basic Layout (HTML)* 
   - Input field for temperature  
   - Radio buttons/dropdown to select conversion type (Celsius to Fahrenheit or vice versa along with Kelvin)  
   - Convert button and result display area

2. *Styled with CSS*  
   - Used color schemes, padding, margins, font styles  
   - Applied layout techniques like Flexbox for neat alignment  
   - Made the design clean and user-friendly

3. *Added JavaScript Logic*  
   - Took user input and validated if it's a number  
   - Applied the formula for converting temperatures  
   - Displayed the result with the correct unit

4. *Tested and Debugged* 
   - Ensured functionality works for all valid inputs  
   - Handled invalid or empty input cases using alerts or messages

# Outcome
The result is a responsive, browser-based *Temperature Converter Website* where users can easily input a temperature value, choose the conversion direction, and view the converted result instantly. It demonstrates a fundamental understanding of DOM manipulation, form handling, and basic programming logic.
